# Web3 Joke App

This project is a decentralized web application that leverages Web3 technology on the Ethereum blockchain (using the Sepolia test network) to create an interactive joke experience. The app displays videos or images that set up a joke without revealing the punchline. Users can guess the punchline for free up to three times. If they fail to guess correctly, they have the option to pay a small fee (0.01 ETH) to unlock and reveal the punchline. The punchline, along with its keccak256 hash, is securely stored on-chain to ensure fair and transparent validation.

The backend smart contract is written in Vyper and handles all the core functionalities: storing jokes (including their punchlines and associated media URIs), tracking each user's number of guesses, and managing payments for revealing the punchline. When users exhaust their free attempts, they must pay the reveal fee, which is added to the jokeâ€™s prize pool. This pool can later be withdrawn by the contract owner. This project demonstrates a fun use-case of integrating blockchain technology with interactive entertainment, showcasing how decentralized apps can manage both content and microtransactions without relying on centralized servers.
